A/B Test Results
================

We tested if the new button color improves clicks.

Data:
Group A (red button): 45 users, 23 clicks
Group B (blue button): 42 users, 28 clicks

Test: We used a chi-square test.

Results: p-value = 0.048

Conclusion: It's significant! The blue button is better.

We should change all buttons to blue immediately.

Additional notes:
- We stopped the test early when we saw the p-value was close to 0.05
- We also tested button size and position but those weren't significant
- Some users saw both versions due to a tracking issue but we kept the data anyway
- The blue button was only shown during peak hours (9am-5pm) while red button was shown 24/7
