A/B Test Analysis: New Feature Impact
======================================

Date: 2025-01-10
Test Duration: 3 weeks

HYPOTHESIS
----------
We hypothesize that the new feature will increase user engagement.

TEST PERFORMED
--------------
We ran a t-test to compare the control and treatment groups.

RESULTS
-------
Control Group:
- Sample size: 245 users
- Mean session duration: 8.2 minutes
- Standard deviation: 2.4 minutes

Treatment Group:
- Sample size: 238 users
- Mean session duration: 9.1 minutes
- Standard deviation: 3.1 minutes

T-test Results:
- t-statistic: 3.45
- p-value: 0.0007
- Degrees of freedom: 481

INTERPRETATION
--------------
The p-value is 0.0007, which is less than our significance level of 0.05. This means the result is statistically significant, and we reject the null hypothesis.

The treatment group has a mean session duration of 9.1 minutes compared to 8.2 minutes in the control group. This is a difference of 0.9 minutes (54 seconds).

Effect Size:
Cohen's d was calculated to be 0.32, which is considered a small to medium effect size.

CONFIDENCE INTERVAL
-------------------
The 95% confidence interval for the difference in means is [0.4, 1.4] minutes.

Since the interval doesn't include zero, this confirms our finding is statistically significant.

SAMPLE SIZE
-----------
We had 245 users in control and 238 in treatment, for a total of 483 users. This should be adequate for detecting medium effects.

ASSUMPTIONS
-----------
We checked that the data was approximately normal using histograms. The sample sizes are reasonably large (>30 in each group), so the t-test should be valid due to the Central Limit Theorem.

There were a few outliers in the data, but we decided to keep them since they represent real user behavior.

CONCLUSION
----------
The new feature significantly increases user session duration by about 0.9 minutes (p<0.001). This represents an 11% increase over the control group.

Based on these results, we recommend implementing the new feature.

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Roll out the feature to all users
2. Monitor engagement over the next month
3. Track other metrics like conversion rate

Note: This analysis was performed using standard t-test procedures. Additional statistical tests could be performed if needed.
